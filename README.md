Script I made for myself to easily generate Fastify APIs as I found myself just writing the same base code for all my backend projects. You can add more plugins simply by adding a "service" in the templates, \_\_depends.json contains the dependencies and environment variables. Files without the hbs extension are simply copied over, but files like script.js.hbs are rendered through handlebars and then copied as script.js.
